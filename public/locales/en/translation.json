      "uranus": "Uranus has an axis of rotation that's tilted sideways relative to the rest of the system. This means the poles get more sunlight than the equator!",
      "neptune": "Neptune is too far away to be seen without a telescope. It was only discovered because of its gravitational effects on Uranus.",
      "pluto": "Pluto is no longer considered a planet because it doesn't dominate its orbit. It's part of the Kuiper Belt along with thousands of other objects. In the time between its discovery and its designation as a dwarf planet, Pluto didn't even complete one orbit around the Sun."
